# eVestment Hackathon Projet

## Summary
For the eVestment Summer Hackathon Project, I decided to utilize my SQL database skills and dig deep in a tech stack that I wasn't very familiar with (C#).
This tool also reaches the database relationally to increase the amount information accessible.
This hack is a developer tool that can be used to receive information from the eVestment database without having to write a SQL query. This is a tool I would have utitilized throughout my summer internship if it was available and I hope it can be helpful for other eVestment developers in the future.

## Future Ideas
If I were to work on this project more in the future, I would create a Chrome Extension that would scrape data from the current profile the user was viewing in the eVestment application. This would improve access to the developer tool and increase information possibilities.
